## MernGPT

Your Personal AI Chatbot
Immerse yourself in the world of AI-powered conversation with MernGPT, a full-fledged MERN (MongoDB, Express, Typescript, Node.js) application designed to replicate the functionalities of ChatGPT.

## Features

- Seamless Interaction: Engage in real-time conversations with a virtual companion, ask questions, and receive insightful responses.
- Captivating Dialogue: Leverage the power of GPT-3.5 or similar language models to experience natural and engaging conversation, just like with a real person.
- Secure and Private: Enjoy a secure and private chatting experience with JWT token-based authentication and password hashing for enhanced protection.
  
## Important

My Model was working completely fine like ChatGpt because I cannot buy the API key that's why the model can't send a response back.
